## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Update Vehicle Data
Replace sample car data in `assets/car-parts-search.js`:

```javascript
// Replace the getCarData() method with your actual vehicle database
getCarData() {
  // Current: Static sample data
  // Production: Fetch from your vehicle database API
  return fetch('/api/vehicles')
    .then(response => response.json());
}
```

### Configure Search Integration
The component is set up to redirect to Shopify search with structured queries:
- **Manual Search**: `/search?q=year:2023 brand:BMW model:X3&type=product`
- **VIN Search**: `/search?q=year:2023 brand:BMW model:X3&type=product&vin=WBA3A5C56DF586123`

### VIN Decoding Integration
For production VIN lookup, integrate with a VIN decoding service:

```javascript
// Example VIN API integration
async performVinLookup(vin) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/vin-decode/${vin}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    // Process VIN data and redirect to search results
  } catch (error) {
    this.showStatus('Грешка при проверка на VIN', 'error');
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Styling & Customization

### Color Scheme
The component uses your existing theme variables:
- Primary color: `var(--color-primary)` (#D32F2F)
- Background: `var(--color-background)` (#FFFFFF)
- Text: `var(--color-text)` (#212121)

### Custom Styling
Add custom CSS to `assets/car-parts-search.css` for additional styling.
